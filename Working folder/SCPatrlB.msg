{113}{}{Well, I'll be damned! Let's see what boss got to give me for your ass...}
{114}{}{(The look-out handcuffs you and takes you to a two-story building)}

# Когда подбегает, чтобы арестовать:
{115}{}{Stop right there!}
{116}{}{You move, you die!}
{117}{}{Hold it right there, punk!}
{118}{}{Don't move!}
{119}{}{I said don't move!}
{120}{}{Don't even dream about getting away!}
{121}{}{You're under arrest, scum!}

#Если ГГ в одежде рейдера:
{130}{}{The look-out spotted you, but didn't recognize you in disguise.}
{131}{}{Hey, Roge, is that you?}
{132}{}{Hey, hold it! Who is this?}
{133}{}{Hey you, in the jacket, who are you?}
{134}{}{Who goes there? Roge, is that you?}
{135}{}{Roge, is that you? Out to throw up again, huh?}

{214}{}{Ain't seen nobody.}
{215}{}{Ain't nobody comin' through here!}
{216}{}{Nothing to say, really.}
{217}{}{I'm on watch.}
{218}{}{It's a bit boring...}

{219}{}{Oh! It's you!}
{220}{}{All quiet. The boss need not worry.}
{221}{}{Ain't seen nobody.}
{222}{}{No one gets through me!}
{223}{}{Nothing to report.}
